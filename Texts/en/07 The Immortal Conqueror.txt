[Intro]

[Verse]
In the depths of darkness, his soul resides
A cruel young nobleman, fueled by pride
With a heart of stone, he pillages the land
Taking what he wants with an iron hand

(Oh-oh-oh)

He marches on, leaving destruction in his reign
Towns and villages, no escape from his raids
He fills his coffers with the spoils of war
No remorse, no pity, just a thirst for more

[Chorus]
With each victory, he grows stronger, he grows bolder (oh-oh-oh)
Unleashing terror, he's the immortal conqueror
He'll stop at nothing, his power knows no end (oh-oh-oh)
He'll rule forever, he's the immortal conqueror

[Bridge]

[Verse]
In the depths of a shadowed castle, a tyrant stands alone
His darkened gaze, a chilling stare, on a heart turned to stone (ooh-yeah)
Born to wealth and power, yet consumed by a hunger for more
He pillages the innocent, leaving their spirits torn

[Chorus]
He's the ruler of chaos, the master of pain (master of pain)
Feasting on the weak, in his wicked domain (wicked domain)
With a heart that's cold as ice and a soul filled with despair
He aims to conquer all, his power beyond compare (ooooh)

[Chorus]
With each victory, he grows stronger, he grows bolder (oh-oh-oh)
Unleashing terror, he's the immortal conqueror
He'll stop at nothing, his power knows no end (oh-oh-oh)
He'll rule forever, he's the immortal conqueror

[Outro]
