[Intro]

[Verse]
A knight in shiny armor, a hero we adored
Fighting battles with a sacred sword
But as the years went by, darkness tinged his soul
The curse took hold, he lost all control

[Chorus]
Corrupted by the night, the bug emerges from the knight
His armor now encrusted in decaying blight
Crawling through the shadows, feasting on despair
Slowly turning into a creature that's beyond repair
(oh no)

[Bridge]

[Verse]
A knight once noble, now a vessel of despair
Beneath his armor, a darkness starts to taint
His eyes once vibrant, now empty and cold
A curse entwined, a fate he can't escape (can't escape)

[Chorus]
Corrupted by the night, the bug emerges from the knight
His armor now encrusted in decaying blight
Crawling through the shadows, feasting on despair
Slowly turning into a creature that's beyond repair

[Chorus]
Oh, the shadows of decay, consuming his soul
As darkness takes its hold, his spirit starts to fold
Like a creature in the night, he writhes and he crawls
The cursed knight, a corrupted bug, he falls (he falls)

(he falls)
(oh no)
(he falls)
(can't escape)
(he falls)

[Outro]
