[Intro]
Through corridors of darkness, where shadows softly tread,
Lies a figure cloaked in sorrow, with tales of crimson dread.
He's seen the horrors of the battle, the pain that stains the soul,
With hands of steel, he weaved the fate, of those where blood did flow.

[Chorus]
Oh, the surgeon's lament echoes through the night
In this darkened world, where hope is out of sight
With every life that he saves, a part of his own dies
In this relentless dance, where evil often lies

(Oblivion is paradise)

[Bridge]

[Verse]
In the shadows of the night, where darkness holds its sway
Lies a surgeon in despair, his soul forever stained (oh-oh-oh).
A veteran of blood and bones, his hands once steady and true
But now haunted by the memories of lives he couldn't save (couldn't save).

[Outro]
Oh, the surgeon's solemn cry echoes through the empty halls (empty halls)
Lost in a sea of sorrow, haunted by the ghosts of war (war).
His heart heavy with the weight of lives that he has lost (he has lost)
Oh-oh-oh, the surgeon's lament, a tale of hope and pain, forever entwined

(Oblivion is paradise)
