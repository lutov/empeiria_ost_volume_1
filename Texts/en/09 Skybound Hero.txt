[Intro]

[Verse]
In a colorful world, where dreams come to life
There's a giant bird, spreading its wings so wide
Flying high above, leaving all behind
It's the freedom it seeks, it's the freedom it finds

[Chorus]
Fly, fly, into the sky 
With its wings, it's gonna touch the sun
Fly, fly, in a fantasy world (oh-oh-oh)
Where the bird is free, and its spirit can't be outdone
Flying high, like it's never been done before
In this beautiful world, the bird will soar (wooooah)

[Solo]

[Verse]
In this bright and sunny world, where colors come alive
There's a giant bird soaring high, in the open sky (burn it up)
With feathers made of fire, and eyes like shining stars
It spreads its wings and takes off, breaking through the bars (fly!)

[Chorus]
Skybound hero, with a spirit unchained (unchained)
Flapping wings in melodies, never to be tamed (never tamed)
Oh, the world is yours for the taking, don't you ever hide (fly high, fly high)
Skybound hero, conquer the sky

[Chorus]
In a colorful world, where dreams come to life
There's a giant bird, spreading its wings so wide
Flying high above, leaving all behind
It's the freedom it seeks, it's the freedom it finds

[Bridge]

[Outro]
