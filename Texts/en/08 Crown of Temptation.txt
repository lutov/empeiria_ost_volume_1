[Intro]

[Verse]
In a castle, lost in splendor
A princess born to reign forever (forever)
But she's searchin', for something more
A hero brave to open new doors (ooh-yeah)

[Verse]
She walks into the room, a royal enchantress
She's full of mischief, her presence's a caress
A naughty princess with a secret desire
To have the hero by her side, igniting her fire

[Chorus]
Come and take your place in my kingdom
Serve me, love me, never leave my side
I'll make you mine, forever and always
You are a temptation that I can no longer hide

(forget you childish pride)
(we are the same inside)

[Chorus]
Oh, servant of my heart, won't you come closer? (come closer)
I'll be your queen, your lover, your forbidden whisper
In my palace of temptation, we'll rule as one
With a crown on my head, and you as my chosen one

(forget you childish pride)
(we are the same inside)

[Outro]
