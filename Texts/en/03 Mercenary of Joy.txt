[Intro]
She's a rebel with a purpose, blazing trails with every step.
Her heart is fierce, her spirit's free, she's like an arrow in the wind.
With a lUte on her back and a smile on her face
She'll fight for what she believes in, never backing down, no trace.

[Chorus]
She's a mercenary of joy, a warrior with a smile.
She'll bring you laughter, she'll bring you life, go on, stay for a while!
With her melodies and lyrics, she'll make your sorrows disappear.
She's a punk rock queen with a mug full of beer

(Heart full of tears)

[Bridge]

[Verse]
She walks the streets with a fire in her eyes -
A heart of gold and a spirit that won't compromise (won't compromise)
She's got a tale to tell, of battles won and lost (oh-oh)
A rebel of steel, she's paying the cost

[Chorus]
She's a rebel with a purpose, blazing trails with every step.
Her heart is fierce, her spirit's free, she's like an arrow in the wind.
With a lUte on her back and a smile on her face
She'll fight for what she believes in, never backing down, no trace.

[Outro]
She's a rebel of steel, with a heart that won't yield (oh-oh-oh)
A mercenary of love, she fights for what is real (what is real)
With every strike, she proves her might (proves her might)
In this crazy world, she's the beacon of light (oh-oh-oh-oh)
