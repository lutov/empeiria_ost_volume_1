[Intro]
In a sleepy little town, where time stood still
Stood a weathered tavern, atop a lonely hill
With its worn wooden floors and its creaky door
Lived a young landlady, wise beyond her years (oh-oh-oh my lady)

[Chorus]
Oh, she pours her heart into every glass she serves
Tales of love and loss, whispered in the night
Her dreams may be shattered, but she won't lose her fight
For the old tavern holds stories, secrets she'll preserve (preserve)

[Bridge]

[Verse]
In an old tavern, down a winding road,
There sits a young maiden, with a heart that's been stolen
She serves weary souls, with a smile on her face
But behind her eyes, a thousand secrets they trace (ooh-ooh)

[Chorus]
Oh, sweet maiden, your spirit shines so bright
Though your heart may be burdened, you're a beacon of light
In the darkest of nights, you bring joy and delight
Oh, sweet maiden of the tavern, let your dreams take flight (ooh-yeah)

[Outro]
In a sleepy little town, where time stood still
Stood a weathered tavern, atop a lonely hill
With its worn wooden floors and its creaky door
Lived a young landlady, wise beyond her years (oh-oh-oh my lady)
