[Intro]
In the shadows, where the darkness takes its form
An eternal flame burns within my soul.
I've tasted immortality, and I've seen the other side.
Bound by ancient spells, I can never be denied.

[Chorus]
I'm unbreakable and unshakable
A mystical force, unstoppable.
Through the ashes, I rise again.
Forever, we'll stand in eternal resonance

[Bridge]

[Verse]
In darkness, we dwell beyond the mortal realm
Lost souls chasing eternal life, the spell.
We dance with fire, and the flames burn bright.
Forbidden knowledge, our souls ignite.

[Chorus]
We are immortal, forever we'll roam
In the shadows, we'll linger, never truly alone.
Fueled by desire and a longing to be free
We defy mortality for all eternity.

[Outro]
I'm unbreakable and unshakable
A mystical force, unstoppable.
Through the ashes, I rise again.
Forever, we'll stand in eternal resonance
